"""Generate the xschem symbols that are derived from another view.

    scripts/gen_xschem_sym.py slot7_wrapper       regenerate just that one
    scripts/gen_xschem_sym.py --help              this text

With a module name, only that symbol (and its _lvs.v, if it has one) is
written.  Every source is still READ, because the 18 slot wrappers share
one bounding box and one row assignment:  regenerating one in isolation
without reading the others would give it a geometry that disagrees with
its siblings.

The two synthesized blocks have 49 and 24 port declarations, which expand
to 227 and 121 physical pins.  Drawing those by hand is not reasonable,
and getting one pin wrong produces an LVS mismatch that is tedious to
find, so the symbol is generated from the same Verilog the block was
synthesized from.

BUSES STAY BUSES.  A port declared [23:0] becomes one symbol pin named
"dig_in[23:0]", which is how the bandgap and bg_trim symbols in this
project express them and how xschem expands them at netlist time.  That
is why 49 declarations give 49 pins rather than 227.

THE 18 SLOT WRAPPERS SHARE ONE FIXED TEMPLATE.  The top level schematic
is one user-project cell drawn once and copied 18 times, with only the
wrapper symbol swapped, so every wrapper must have the same bounding box
and must put each shared pin at the same coordinates.  Only the analog
pins differ between slots:  the main analog vector (s<N>_an, 1 to 3 bits)
sits at a fixed row ABOVE the ESD pins (s<N>_an_<K>_esd, 1 to 3 of them),
which occupy the last rows and are simply absent when a slot has fewer.
See SLOT_ROWS.  Swapping a pad for a different one changes only which of
those bottom rows are populated, so the wires in the schematic stay put.

FILE ORDER AND DRAWING POSITION ARE INDEPENDENT.  A primitive netlists
positionally, so the B lines must stay in magic's port-index order (see
emit()), but where a pin is DRAWN is a separate choice.  The template
therefore fixes coordinates without touching the netlist order.

POWER PINS COME FROM THE LAYOUT, NOT THE RTL.  housekeeping_top declares
VPWR/VGND inside `ifdef USE_POWER_PINS, but the flow emits them as
vddd/vssd, and user_project_control declares none at all while its DEF
still has both.  The symbol has to match the LAYOUT, since that is what
LVS compares against, so VPWR/VGND are dropped and vddd/vssd are added.
Verified against the final DEF of each block: 227 and 121 pins, exact.

    # file's port order.  Taking the ports from the same file makes the two
