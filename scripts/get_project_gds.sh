# get_project_gds.sh ---
#
# Find each user project's GDS in its submodule and write the Tcl that
# drops those layouts into the chip top level.  Run from the repository
# top level:
#
#	scripts/get_project_gds.sh [options] [<slot> ...]
#
#	  -n, --dry-run	  say what would be written, write nothing
#	  -h, --help
#
# The output is scripts/user_projects.tcl, which run_gen_prefill_gds.sh
# sources while the chip top level is the edit cell.  Each populated slot
# contributes a "gds read" of the user's file and a "getcell" that places
# it over the matching slot wrapper.  Nothing else needs to source it:
# run_gen_filled_final_gds.sh builds from the pre-fill GDS, which by then
# already contains the projects.
#
# Users are instructed to provide a file named slot_<N>.gds holding a top
# cell of the same name, generated with full hierarchical processing.  It
# is read with "gds readonly true" so that it goes in verbatim.
#
# Reading it read-only is not by itself enough to keep user cell names
# apart.  A read-only cell records the byte range of its own definition in
# GDS_START and GDS_END, and magic copies exactly that range back out, so
# the names inside it survive untouched and two users who both started
# from slot<N>_wrapper.gds would collide.  Clearing GDS_END and setting
# GDS_START to 0 makes magic take the whole file instead and give every
# cell below the top level a unique prefix.  The top cell keeps its name,
# which is why that name has to be agreed in advance.
#
# WHERE THE GDS IS LOOKED FOR, in order:
#
#	<repo>/final/gds/	the structure IHP prefers
#	<repo>/gds/		the structure this project prefers
#	anywhere in <repo>	last resort, for any other layout
#
# Both slot_<N>.gds and slot_<N>.gds.gz are accepted, but finding both is
# an error rather than a preference:  the point of this script is to pin
# down exactly what went into a tapeout, and quietly choosing one of two
# candidates is the kind of decision nobody discovers until they ask which
# one shipped.  A slot with no project assigned in config.txt is skipped
# without complaint;  every other failure is reported, all slots are
# processed regardless, and the exit status is nonzero if any failed.
#
# WHY THE PLACEMENTS COME FROM MAGIC AND NOT FROM THE .mag FILES.  The
# positions exist already, as the transforms on the slot<N>_wrapper_0
# instances in chipalooza_frame.  Reading them out of the file by hand is
# a trap:  .mag integers are internal units scaled by the "magscale" line
# at the top of each file, and the two files involved here do not agree
# --- chipalooza_frame.mag is "magscale 1 2" (200 units/micron) while
# sg13cmos5l_ocd_chipalooza.mag has no magscale line at all (100 units/
# micron).  Composing across them gives every project a position wrong by
# a factor of two on the frame offset, which is 8.05um of silent, DRC-
# clean misplacement.  So this script asks magic, with "units microns" in
# force, and merely transcribes the answer.  Only the mirror flag is read
# from the file, as the sign of the transform's first element, which no
# scaling can affect.
