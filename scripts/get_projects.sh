#! /bin/bash
#
# get_projects.sh ---
#
# Manage the eighteen user project repositories as git submodules of this
# repository.  Each slot's repository URL comes from the "s<N>_source"
# entries in config.txt, and the version to use comes from the matching
# "s<N>_version" entry.  Whatever the repository is called upstream, it
# is checked out as dependencies/slot_<N>, so that everything downstream
# can refer to a slot by its number alone.
#
# Usage (run from the repository top level):
#
#	scripts/get_projects.sh [options] [<slot> ...]
#
#	  (no option)	  clone any project that is not yet a submodule and
#			  check out the version recorded in config.txt
#	  -s, --status	  report each slot without changing anything
#	  -u, --update	  also move already-cloned projects onto the version
#			  in config.txt (this is how you take an update:
#			  edit the branch or hash, then run this)
#	  -c, --clean	  remove every project submodule, returning the
#			  harness to its empty state
#	  -f, --force	  with --clean, remove a project even though it has
#			  uncommitted changes in it
#	  -n, --dry-run	  print what would be done
#	  -h, --help
#
#	<slot> is a slot number, 1 to 18.  With none given, all eighteen
#	are considered.
#
# VERSION PINNING.  The "s<N>_version" entry has two fields, a branch and
# a commit:
#
#	s3_version:	chipalooza	a4b21e0...
#
# The branch may be "(default)" or "-" to mean the remote's own default
# branch --- we do not assume "main", because these are eighteen
# independent repositories and some use "master".
#
# The commit is what actually freezes a tapeout.  It may be "(none)" or
# "-" to mean "track the branch", in which case this script records the
# hash it actually checked out back into config.txt.  So the sequence
#
#	scripts/get_projects.sh		# clone at the branch tip
#	git commit config.txt .gitmodules dependencies/
#
# leaves a config.txt that names an exact commit for every slot, and a
# later run of this script reproduces that state exactly.  A hash that is
# already recorded is never overwritten;  to move a project forward you
# edit config.txt yourself and run with --update.
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT DO.  It stages its work but never commits.
# Adding or moving a submodule changes .gitmodules and the gitlink in the
# index, and those belong in a commit you write, next to the config.txt
# change that motivated them.
